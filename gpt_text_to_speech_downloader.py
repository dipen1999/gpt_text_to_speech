This application executes a `cURL` command, converts the resulting audio file to MP3 using `ffmpeg-python`, and offers it for download.

**How to use:**
1.  Paste your full `cURL` command into the text area below. The app handles commands copied from the Windows Command Prompt (by removing `^` characters).
2.  Enter a desired name for the output file.
3.  Click the "Generate and Download MP3" button.

The app will download the audio, convert it to `.mp3`, and provide a download link.
